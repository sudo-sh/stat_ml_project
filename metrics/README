This directory contains the metric data we collected on all the various classifiers and datasets.

All the accuracy, timing and memory metrics were run on a machine with the following specs:
   1) Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04
   2) Processor:	AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core Processor, 3593 Mhz, 8 Core(s), 16 Logical Processor(s)
   3) GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER
   4) 32.0 GB RAM
   
The timing and memory tests were run multiple times and the results were averaged to maximize reliability and reproducability.
No other processes were running in the background to minimize external influence on the tests.
